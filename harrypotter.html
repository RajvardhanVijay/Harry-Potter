        <h2><b>Summary</b></h2>
        
        <section><em>Harry Potter</em> is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. 
            The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard,<em>Harry Potter</em>, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
            The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against <span>Lord Voldemort</span> , a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).
            <em>Harry Potter</em> is a multimedia franchise about an orphaned boy who enrolls at Hogwarts School of Wizardry, where he learns the truth about himself, his family, and the terrible evil that haunts the magical world.
            Adopted from the novels, <em>Harry Potter</em> is an eight-episode film saga that follows the journey of <em>Harry Potter</em> and his friends, Hermoine Granger and Ron Weasley, as they navigate the tricky world of growing up, school life, and magic.
            Starting from year one and moving to their seventh year, the films chronicle the students' time at Hogwarts while unfurling a sinister plot that centers around the unsuspecting Harry.
            With the return of the dark wizard, Voldemort, the students, and professors at Hogwarts will fight to carry on as the world around them may change forever. <em>Harry Potter</em> has expanded beyond the world of its film and novels, with several video games, a spin-off film series titled Fantastic Beasts, and more.</section>
